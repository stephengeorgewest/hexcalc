// Given a length, draw connecting lines to form the hexagon
// The hexagon will be a flat
// Point 1 will be the upper right vertex, which is one half the side length.
// Point 2 will be one side length horzontall from Point 1
// Point 3 will be One Apothem down and one half side length right of Point 2
// Point 4 will be one half side length left and one Apothem down from Point 3
// Point 5 will be one side length left of Point 4
// Point 6 will be one Apothem high and one half side length left of Point 5
// Connect to Point 1 will be one half side length right and one Apothem high from Point 6
